* How to run locally:

1. Run "npm install" in your terminal. In case, if you don't have npm, you have to install npm on your computer.
2. Then you have set up the .env file. Create a .env file and set the value of each key in .env file. So there are basically four keys (PORT DATABASE_URL, NODE_DEV BCRYPT_SALT_ROUNDS ).
3. Then take a look at the package.json file to see the commands.
